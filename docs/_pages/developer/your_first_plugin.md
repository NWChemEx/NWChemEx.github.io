To make life easy the NWChemEx team has created a plugin template which can be 
obtained by using the 
[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) python 
package. Instructions for obtaining and configuring the template can be
found [here](https://github.com/NWChemEx/PluginTemplate).
