The NWChemEx ecosystem is predicated on the assumption that developers are 
interested in creating and consuming modular software. We begin with an 
overview of what modular software is. From there we sketch out the high-level
steps needed to create a plugin or extend an existing plugin. The contents of
this page are conceptual links to concrete tutorials are provided throughout.

## What is a modular software package?

- Idea is to explain what a modular software package looks like and to
  introduce the basic considerations of designing such a package.
- Key point: achieved by worrying about composing quantities, and not how the
  quantity is computed.

## What is a software module?

- Introduce as opposite of the software, i.e., not worried about where inputs
  came from, just worried about computing something from those inputs. 

## Modularity within NWChemEx

- Introduce module and plugin terminology.

## Developing a plugin

## Adding a module to a plugin

## Next Steps
