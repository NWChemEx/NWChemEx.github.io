The NWChemEx community views anyone who writes software which interfaces with
NWChemEx as an NWChemEx developer. That said, the topics in this section will be 
most useful if you are:

- A developer/maintainer of an existing library, tool, or software package and
  you want to make the library, tool, or software package interoperable with
  the NWChemEx ecosystem.
- A software developer looking to create a library, tool, or software package
  and you want the library, tool, or software package to be readily usable by
  the both the NWChemEx ecosystem and the broader community.
