Not everyone uses NWChemEx in the same way. Some people simply want to run
computations. Others want to add new features. To help disambiguate among common
use cases for NWChemEx, the community has established what we call "roles." The
roles are:

- community member,
- developer, and
- author.

It helps to think of the roles as being nested like:

![Relationship among NWChemEx roles](/assets/community_overview.png)

The idea is that authors are a subset of the developers and the developers are
a subset of the community members. 

**Community members** are the easiest to define. Community members are anyone 
who  interacts with NWChemEx in any manner whatsoever. Whether you are
contributing intricate algorithms to the code base, running calculations, or
just perusing the source code, consider yourself a member of the community!
**Developers** are the subset of the community members who create software
that in some shape or form interacts with NWChemEx. It doesn't matter if that 
software sits on top of NWChemEx, is a plugin for NWChemEx, or if that code is 
in an intricate part of NWChemEx's infrastructure, by interacting with NWChemEx
on a code-level, you are a developer! **Authors** are developers who contribute
to the source-code repositories owned by the NWChemEx organization.

Ultimately, the team introduced roles to help distinguish among target users.
Documentation, tutorials, and features targeting community members are the most
general. They are of interest to almost anyone interacting with NWChemEx. 
Similarly, documentation, tutorials, and features targeting developers will be
of interest to anyone writing software that interacts with NWChemEx; however,
community members who are not developers will generally speaking not find
such topics relevant. Finally, documentation, tutorials, and features
targeting authors is unlikely to be of interest to community members who do
not fall under the author label.

# FAQs

## Is writing "X" sufficient for being labeled a developer (or author)?

Yes, if you want it to be. The community places no restrictions on how large a
contribution needs to be. Honestly, we're fine if you want to consider yourself
an author without ever having written a single line of code. The roles exist
not to exclude people, but to categorize information.

## What if I don't want to be a community member, developer, or author?

That's fine. Similar to the answer from the previous question, you are free to
refer to yourself with whatever role you would like. You are also free to not
use the roles either.

## Can I use the member, developer, author badge to promote my role?

Absolutely! The badges, i.e., these things:

![NWChemEx Developer](/assets/logos/nwx_developer.png)
![NWChemEx Author](/assets/logos/nwx_author.png)

are designed to be put in slide decks or personal websites for this reason.
